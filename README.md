# Database-Experimentations
Trying out on database and scheduling tools.

## About the Project
This project is conducted to try out on various tools to automate data collection and storing the data into structured databases. 

The data is obtained from the [Cinema Online](http://www.cinemaonline.sg/movies/nowshowing.aspx) website, where the website shows the latest movies screening on cinemas in Singapore. 

The scripts can be executed to crawl data from this site and transform the crawled output into a structured data frame, before inserting the rows into a database.
